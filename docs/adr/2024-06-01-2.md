# Use of Kafka

## Status
Accepted

## Context
* System needs to be able to handle high volume of parcels. 
* System needs to scale easily as the number of parcels grows.
* System needs to be fault-tolerant. 
* System needs to be upgradable without downtime.

## Decision
Use of event based architecture looks like no-brainer. 
* It allows easy scaling as the system grows.
* It allows partial upgrades as long as events are persistent
* It is possible to plan introducing breaking changes without downtime.
* Kafka is a stable, well established and proven solution for event based architecture (Netflix for reference)


## Consequences
* Needs maintenance and monitoring
* Suboptimal configuration of Kafka can lead to performance issues
* Breaking changes rollouts needs to be carefully planed in advance in production environment
