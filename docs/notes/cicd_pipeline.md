This project has no build artefacts nor do not need to be deployed. Hence, no CI/CD pipeline is needed.
However, *"it works on my machine"* and *"it's just a pet project/PoC/sandbox"* is not a valid excuse.
One of the easiest way to validate if the project builds and run on anything other than your machine is to run it
on a different box. 

As this project is hosted on GitHub, we can use GitHub Actions at no extra costs. Just to see if it builds,
and tests pass. 

As a bonus I'm using Coveralls to track test coverage.
