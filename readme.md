## Hot to run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install 🐳 Docker
    
    You will need *docker-compose* so depending on wether you're installing Docker Desktop or just CLI you might need to install it separately. Refere to docker installation guid for details.
3. Open terminal and run:

```bash
./run.sh
```

This should build and spin up the project(s). Also it should open a simple webage with links to all the services and tools.
